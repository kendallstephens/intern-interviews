      <p>Hi, <span class="wave">ðŸ‘‹</span>! Iâ€™m Kendall, a recent graduate of Flatiron Schoolâ€™s immersive Software Engineering Program. Iâ€™m looking for my first home as a full stack engineer where I can integrate my past experience in leadership and project management with my new engineering skills to make a positive impact on user experience.</p>
      <p>My interest in software engineering began after having the great opportunity to work cross-functionally with our engineering team at WeWork. While leading quarterly focus groups to analyze customer satisfaction of our mobile application, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of how the team utilized this feedback to guide the development of new features. I was so interested in the process that I started taking courses in my spare time to learn to code, and fell so in love that I decided to enroll at Flatiron School!</p>
      <p> I want to be a software engineer because Iâ€™ve seen firsthand how great user interfaces and system designs can have a huge impact on the people who interact with your product, and I want to be a part of a team who improves that experience through thoughtful engineering.</p>
      <p>I would love the opportunity to start my journey at Lob and be a part of your vision of <i>increasing the connectivity between the offline and online worlds.</i></p>
